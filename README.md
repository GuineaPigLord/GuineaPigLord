# About me

Hello, I am interested in AI. I code mostly in python and recently C++, but I am also learning Rust, Assembly, etc. Please refer to ethicalhacker7192 instead of this account.

I am always learning and enjoy problem-solving challenges. 

I'd hate to put a short README out there, but..nothing to see here!
